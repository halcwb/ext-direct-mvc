* Run *build.cmd* [![AppVeyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/17969592ymx2rqic)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/halcwb/ext-direct-mvc)


Ext.Direct.Mvc is an implementation of Ext Direct server-side stack for ASP.NET MVC. Ext Direct is a platform and language agnostic technology to remote server-side methods to the client-side. Ext Direct allows for seamless communication between the client-side of an Ext JS application and all popular server platforms. For more information about Ext Direct visit http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/extdirect.

*  Support for different types of parameters - simple types, complex types and arrays
*  Form post values can be bound to multiple simple type parameters, a single complex type parameter (object) or a mix of both on the server
*  Support for method aliases
*  Exceptions with full stack trace and additional user-defined data for easy debugging
*  Support for custom server-side events
*  Support for named arguments (Ext JS 4.x)

## Compiling the source

You need to open the solution in Visual Studio 2012 and allow NuGet to download missing packages before attempting to build it.
To do that go to the Options > Package Manager > General and check "Allow NuGet to download missing packages during build".

## Quick Start

Here's how to quickly start using Ext.Direct.Mvc in your project:

In your ASP.NET MVC project add a reference to Ext.Direct.Mvc dll and the Newtonsoft.Json dll that comes with it. It is important that you reference the included Newtonsoft.Json.dll file because Ext.Direct.Mvc is compiled against it.

Add a script tag to your main view, normally Views/Home/Index.cshtml, and set its scr attribute to "~/DirectApi" relative to the root of your application. It outputs the method configurations for Ext Direct to create client-side stubs.

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="@Url.Content("~/DirectApi")"></script>
```

Add an Ext.Direct Provider to creates the proxy, or stub methods, to execute server-side methods. Because most of the time you will need stub methods before defining custom components, this should be done early in your code:

```
// in Ext JS 4 or Sencha Touch 2
Ext.direct.Manager.addProvider(Ext.app.REMOTING_API);

// or in Ext JS 3
Ext.Direct.addProvider(Ext.app.REMOTING_API);
```

Make sure that controllers which are intended to be used by Ext Direct inherit **DirectController** as opposed to just Controller.

Return data from controller actions by calling one of the overriden **Json** methods. Actions that process form posts must be marked with `[FormHandler]` attribute.

**That's it!** Now you can call your controller actions directly from your JavaScript code through the created stub methods.
